Redux from cAm 

model, state, view setup is ow websites are developed. 

Model is how you interface with the website, state is what the website asm view is h0ow the information is protray.ed 

Ex. click a button; says how many times how you clicked it. Model is the button. States is the number of clicks. View is the number being displaye.

Model and they see the view
Angular is model state and view. 

React is just view. 

Tis is the quedstion, now of. Model is plain HTMLd
State has a cople diff solutions ; most popular is redux. 

state is as follows. 
Say you have website with a navbar and a page
Now click on signin; want the page to now show signin 

one way of doing things, the bad way, is that if we have a massive state that has a done off different stupid attributes. 

What Redux does is:
    note the followin terms:
        Store - all the information foer the entire app ; everything is connected to the redux store. 
        reducers - key value pairs in the noraml this.state object. 
            eac key has its own reducer. A store is made by combining reducers into a store. 
        actions - object that has a type and a payload. PAyload is any JS content. 
        actionCreatoReact components are the view layer for the state. rs
        thunk and thunk creators

you edit a store by sending an action into a resducer. 

action creator -> action -> reducer -> store 

react components now have access to these acces creators. 

When the store updates, it will update the react components. 

eat sttribute of the state has its own reducer file in redux
every action  has its own type an what not
